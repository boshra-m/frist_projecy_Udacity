          When we think of giant pandas, we think of lovely black and white
          bears. They are cute and have many fans all over the world.

        <ul class="frist-ul">
          The following are 4 fascinating fact:

          <li class="facts">
            <span> giant panda is much bigger than your teddy bear:</span>
            An adult panda weight more than 45 kilos (100 pounds), and can be
            about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long!
          </li>
          <li class="facts">
            <span> go from pink to white and black (or brown):</span>Panda is
            born pink, and blind. The iconic black and white color come later,
            after about three weeks.
          </li>
          <li class="facts">
            <span>Pandas are "lazy" </span>They spend as long as 14 hours eating
            per day, and spend the rest of their time in sleeping.
          </li>
          <li class="facts">
            <span>Pandas have carnivorous teeth.</span>but they eat bamboo and
            fruit. We all know them as eating only bamboo, but they like some
            fruit too, and can eat meat.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="second-p">
          Pandas are usually born in August, because the panda's mating months
          are March to May and gestation is 3 to 5 months...
